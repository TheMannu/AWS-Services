There are several types of databases, each designed for different use cases and data models. The two primary categories are **relational (SQL)** and **non-relational (NoSQL)** databases, but there are also specialized databases for specific purposes. The different types:

---

### **1. Relational Databases (SQL)**
-**Definition**: These databases organize data into tables (rows and columns) with predefined relationships between the data. They follow a schema, ensuring that data is structured and consistent.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Tables with rows and columns (like spreadsheets).
  - Supports complex queries using SQL (Structured Query Language).
  - Ensures data integrity through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.

- **Examples**:
  - **MySQL**: Popular open-source RDBMS, commonly used in web applications.
  - **PostgreSQL**: Advanced open-source RDBMS with support for complex queries, indexing, and JSON.
  - **Oracle Database**: Enterprise-grade relational database, known for handling large-scale operations.
  - **Microsoft SQL Server**: Proprietary RDBMS used in enterprise environments.
