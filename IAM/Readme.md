# AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

AWS IAM provides secure control over who can access the AWS resources and how they can do so.

This repository contains notes on AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). The following sections include information on Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies, with practical examples for both AWS CLI and AWS Management Console.
