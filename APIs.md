An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with external services, libraries, or operating systems. APIs enable seamless interaction between systems, facilitating data exchange and functional integration.

### Key aspects of APIs include:
- **Functionality**: APIs provide specific features or data from an application for developers to use, such as retrieving user details, sending data, or managing system resources.
- **Request and Response**: APIs operate on a request-response model, where a client makes a request to the API and receives a response containing the requested data or result.

### Types of APIs:
1. **Open APIs (Public APIs)**: Publicly accessible with no restrictions, allowing anyone to use them.  
   - **Example**: The **Google Maps API** allows developers to integrate map functionality into their applications.
   
2. **Partner APIs**: Restricted access, requiring specific rights or licenses.  
   - **Example**: The **Twitter API** allows businesses with permission to access specific data and functionalities.
   
3. **Internal APIs (Private APIs)**: Used within an organization to improve internal productivity.  
   - **Example**: **Amazon's internal APIs** for managing inventory and customer orders.
