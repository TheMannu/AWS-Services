An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with external services, libraries, or operating systems. APIs enable seamless interaction between systems, facilitating data exchange and functional integration.

### Key aspects of APIs include:
- **Functionality**: APIs provide specific features or data from an application for developers to use, such as retrieving user details, sending data, or managing system resources.
- **Request and Response**: APIs operate on a request-response model, where a client makes a request to the API and receives a response containing the requested data or result.
