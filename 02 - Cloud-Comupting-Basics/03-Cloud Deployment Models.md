# Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud deployment models define how cloud resources are deployed and accessed.

## Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud**: Resources like Compute services, Storage, Servers and Database are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and shared with other customers over the internet. Example: AWS, Azure, GCP.
- **Private Cloud**: Resources like Compute services, Storage, Servers and Database are used exclusively by a single organization. Example: On-premises data center.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. Example: Using AWS for public cloud and an on-premises data center for private cloud.

## Use Cases

- **Public Cloud**: Suitable for applications with varying demand.
- **Private Cloud**: Ideal for sensitive data requiring high security.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Offers flexibility and scalability while maintaining security.
