**High Availability (HA)** ensurs that our application or system remains available and operational even in the event of a failure, such as a data center or server outage.

### **1. Increased Service Availability**
   - **High Availability** ensures that services or applications remain accessible with minimal or no downtime. This is crucial for businesses that require continuous access, such as e-commerce platforms or critical applications.

### **2. High Availability and Horizontal Scaling**
   - **High availability** often works in conjunction with **horizontal scaling**. By adding multiple instances across different locations, the system can withstand failures without compromising the service.
   - **Horizontal scaling** adds more instances across multiple servers or data centers, improving the availability and fault tolerance of the application.

### **3. Redundancy Across Availability Zones**
   - High availability means running your application across **at least two data centers**, which in AWS are called **Availability Zones** (AZs). By distributing instances across multiple AZs, if one data center (AZ) goes down, the others can continue running your application.

### **4. Surviving Data Center Loss**
   - The goal of high availability is to **survive the failure of an entire data center** or an Availability Zone. This ensures that your application remains operational even if there is a major outage in one of the zones.
