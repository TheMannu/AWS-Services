Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a scalable and fully managed file storage service designed for use with AWS services and on-premises resources. EFS provides a shared file system that can be mounted simultaneously by multiple EC2 instances, making it ideal for use cases that require shared access to file data. Hereâ€™s an overview of key concepts and features of AWS EFS:

### 1. **Key Features of AWS EFS**
   - **Fully Managed**: EFS automatically handles the infrastructure, making it simple to set up, scale, and manage file systems.
   - **Scalable**: EFS scales automatically to handle growing amounts of data without any manual intervention.
   - **Shared Access**: Multiple EC2 instances across different Availability Zones can simultaneously mount an EFS file system, allowing for distributed file storage.
   - **Elastic**: EFS automatically scales up or down as you add or remove files, without needing to provision storage in advance.
   - **POSIX-compliant**: EFS is designed for workloads that require file system interfaces, file access semantics (locking), and permissions models.
   
### 2. **Performance Modes**
   - **General Purpose**: Best suited for latency-sensitive use cases like web serving, content management, and development environments.
   - **Max I/O**: Designed for use cases that require high throughput and can tolerate higher latencies, such as big data analytics or media processing.
