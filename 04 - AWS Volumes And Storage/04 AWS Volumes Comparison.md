Comparison of **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)**, **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)**, and **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)**, focusing on key factors like storage type, scalability, use cases, and pricing:

### 1. **Storage Type**
   - **EBS**: Block storage for single EC2 instances. EBS volumes are like virtual hard drives that attach to an EC2 instance.
   - **EFS**: Managed network file storage that can be mounted simultaneously by multiple EC2 instances, allowing shared access to file systems across instances.
   - **S3**: Object storage, ideal for storing large amounts of unstructured data (files, backups, media, etc.). S3 does not work like a traditional file system but stores objects in buckets.

### 2. **Performance and Scalability**
   - **EBS**:
     - Provisioned performance based on volume type (e.g., SSD or HDD).
     - Fixed size defined at creation, but can be increased manually.
     - Performance optimized for high-throughput and low-latency workloads on a single EC2 instance.
   - **EFS**:
     - Automatically scales up or down based on usage.
     - Supports both **General Purpose** and **Max I/O** performance modes.
     - Highly scalable with distributed architecture allowing thousands of concurrent connections.
   - **S3**:
     - Infinitely scalable with automatic scaling based on object storage needs.
     - Designed for massive throughput and storing billions of objects.
     - Suitable for static websites, backups, media files, and large-scale data analytics.
