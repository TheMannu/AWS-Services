### **Traditional Infrastructure vs AWS Cloud Services**

| **Category**            | **Traditional Infrastructure**                   | **AWS Cloud Services**                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Firewall & Security**  | Physical firewalls to protect the network.       | **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, and **NACLs (Network ACLs)** at the subnet level in a VPC. |
| **Access Control**       | Manual Access Control Lists (ACLs) to manage network access. | **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)** for centralized access control and policies. |
| **Network Devices**      | Physical routers and switches for networking.    | **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Virtual network with routing managed through AWS. |
| **Load Balancing**       | Manual load balancers (hardware or software).    | **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Automatically distributes traffic across EC2 instances. |
| **Server Management**    | On-premises physical servers managed by admins.  | **Amazon EC2 Instances**: Scalable, virtualized cloud servers that can be spun up on demand. |
| **Storage Solutions**    | SAN (Storage Area Network) and NAS (Network-Attached Storage). | **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)** for block storage, and **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)** for managed file storage. |
| **Database Management**  | On-premise databases, often RDBMS.               | **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Fully managed database service. |
| **Scaling**              | Slow and expensive, requiring hardware purchases and setup. | Instant scaling based on demand (auto-scaling of EC2 instances, storage, etc.). |
| **Cost**                 | High upfront costs for hardware, maintenance, and physical space. | **Pay-as-you-go** pricing, based on usage with no upfront infrastructure costs. |
| **Management & Updates** | Requires manual updates, security patches, and constant IT oversight. | AWS automates updates, scaling, and security patches, reducing manual intervention. |

### **Key Differences:**
1. **Hardware vs Virtualization**: Traditional infrastructure relies on physical hardware that must be purchased, installed, and maintained, while AWS offers virtualized services accessible on-demand.
2. **Manual Management vs Automation**: In traditional setups, administrators manage firewalls, servers, and networks manually. AWS automates many aspects such as scaling, security, and backups.
3. **Network Infrastructure**: Traditional infrastructure uses physical routers, switches, and cabling. AWS uses **VPCs** (Virtual Private Clouds) to create secure, isolated networks that are completely virtual.
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Traditional infrastructure requires significant capital investment upfront for servers, networking equipment, and storage. AWS operates on a **pay-as-you-go** model, minimizing upfront costs and only charging for what you use.
5. **Flexibility**: Traditional setups are rigid and hard to scale without purchasing new hardware. AWS allows instant scalability, making it easy to adapt to changing demands with **auto-scaling** and managed services.
